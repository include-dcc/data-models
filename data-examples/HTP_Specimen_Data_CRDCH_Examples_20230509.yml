# HTP Example:  Processing of HTP001B Collection into 8 subsamples (some of which are aliquoted into many different containers). 
# Each of these has a record in the HTP dataset (those aliquoted into many containers have many records - one for each container)
# HTP Data Source: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51384359,  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HaXIs_7T1j4EF-MhLKdTmPylcG8MWesJLsMMTJwopIk/edit#gid=0

# Specimen Derivation Hierarchy in this example:

# HTP0001B_Whole Blood (via Blood Draw, 1 container, used up)
#	 HTP0001B_Whole Blood EDTA  (via Blood Draw + EDTA addition?), 1 container, used up)
#		HTP0001B_Plasma (via centrifugation, split into 26 aliquoted containers) - initial derived specimen*
#			182571463  (via aliquoting, 1 ml in a tube) - one aliquot of the plasma specimen
#		HTP0001B_Red Blood Cells (via centrifugation, split into 14 aliquoted containers) - initial derived specimen*
#			189024010 (via aliquoting, 1 ml in a tube) - one aliquot of the initial RBC specimen
#		HTP0001B_White Blood Cells  (via RBC lysis, 1 container) - initial derived specimen
#			HTP0001B_CD4+ Tconv cells (via FACS, 1 container)
#			HTP0001B_CD8+ T cells (via FACS, 1 container)
#			HTP0001B_Monocytes  (via FACS, 1 container)
#			HTP0001B_NK cells(via FACS, 1 container)
 
# * = a specimen record not represent in source data, because the specimen existed transiently and was immediately aliquoted. But it existed at one time, and is necessary to create a record of this for a fully consistent, provenanced account, and a CCDH compliant representation
